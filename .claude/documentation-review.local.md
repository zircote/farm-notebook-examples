# Project Documentation Notes

## Audience

Primary audience is farmers, ranchers, and agronomists who may have limited
technical experience. Documentation should:

- Define all technical terms on first use
- Provide step-by-step instructions with expected output
- Include "what you should see" confirmations after key steps
- Use plain language over jargon
- Offer troubleshooting tips for common errors

## Documentation Inventory

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| README.md | Project overview, notebook table of contents, quick start |
| INSTALL.md | Concise installation guide with cloud alternatives |
| SETUP.md | Detailed step-by-step setup for all platforms |
| CLAUDE.md | AI assistant instructions (not user-facing) |
| notebooks/*.ipynb | 7 Jupyter notebooks with inline markdown documentation |

## Notebook Documentation Standards

Each notebook should contain:
1. Title cell (`# Notebook Title`) with purpose description
2. "How to Run This Notebook" section with prerequisites
3. Setup cell with grouped imports (stdlib / third-party / config)
4. Alternating markdown/code cells with explanations before code
5. Conclusion section with key findings and next steps

## Review Priorities

1. **Accuracy**: Do instructions match actual commands and file paths?
2. **Completeness**: Are all steps included with no assumed knowledge?
3. **Consistency**: Do notebooks follow the same structure and conventions?
4. **Links**: Do cross-references between notebooks and docs work?
5. **Beginner clarity**: Would a first-time Jupyter user understand?
