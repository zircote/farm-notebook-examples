    "PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "=================\n",
    "Our 200-acre cattle operation in southern Missouri has experienced\n",
    "declining forage productivity and increased runoff over the past decade.\n",
    "Soil tests from Fall 2025 show organic matter averaging 1.95% across\n",
    "the North and South pastures, well below the 3-4% target for healthy\n",
    "grasslands in our region. Water infiltration rates of 0.3-0.5 inches\n",
    "per hour indicate compacted soils, contributing to sheet erosion and\n",
    "nutrient loss into Willow Creek.\n",
    "\n",
    "PROPOSED SOLUTION\n",
    "=================\n",
    "We propose to implement adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grazing across\n",
    "120 acres, dividing continuous pasture into 16 paddocks using\n",
    "high-tensile electric fencing with solar-powered energizers. A new\n",
    "water pipeline and tank system will provide stock water to each\n",
    "paddock, eliminating the need for cattle to access the creek directly.\n",
    "We will overseed with a diverse mix of native warm-season grasses and\n",
    "legumes to improve forage quality and ground cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPECTED OUTCOMES (3-Year Targets)\n",
    "===================================\n",
    "- Increase soil organic matter from 1.95% to 2.8% (+0.85%)\n",
    "- Improve water infiltration from 0.4 to 1.0 inches/hour\n",
    "- Reduce bare ground from 25% to under 5%\n",
    "- Increase stocking rate by 20% through improved forage\n",

    "## Tips for Small and Beginning Farmers\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to farming or run a small operation, you are not at a disadvantage in the\n",
    "grant process -- in fact, many programs give you priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Priority Programs\n",
    "- **EQIP** reserves funding specifically for beginning farmers (farming less than 10 years)\n",
    "  and socially disadvantaged producers.\n",
    "- **SARE Farmer/Rancher Grants** are designed for working producers, not academics. Awards\n",
    "  are typically $500-$15,000 and the application is short.\n",
    "- **FSA Microloans** (up to $50,000) can complement grants for startup costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding a Mentor\n",
    "- Contact your local NRCS office and ask for a conservation planner.\n",
    "- Reach out to your state's Beginning Farmer program or Extension Service.\n",
    "- Savory Hubs often pair new practitioners with experienced graziers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "1. **Vague outcomes** -- \"improve soil health\" is too broad. Use numbers: \"increase OM from 2% to 3%.\"\n",
    "2. **Unrealistic timelines** -- build in buffer time for weather delays.\n",
    "3. **Ignoring match requirements** -- track your labor hours; they count as in-kind match.\n",
    "4. **Waiting until the deadline** -- start your application 6-8 weeks early.\n",
    "5. **Not talking to NRCS first** -- they will help you identify which practices qualify."
