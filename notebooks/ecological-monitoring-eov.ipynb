    "\n",
    "EOV is a science-based method for measuring whether your land management practices are actually improving the soil, water, biodiversity, and overall ecosystem on your farm or ranch. It was developed by the Savory Institute as part of their Land to Market program, which connects regenerative producers to buyers who value verified ecological outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does this matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- It gives you hard numbers to prove your land is improving (or flag problems early)\n",
    "- It qualifies you for the Land to Market seal, opening premium market access\n",
    "- It builds a documented record for grant applications and conservation programs\n",
    "- It connects your holistic management decisions to measurable results on the ground\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you are just starting holistic management or have been doing it for years, EOV gives you a consistent way to answer the question: **Is my land getting healthier?**"

    "## What is EOV?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ecological Outcome Verification (EOV)** is a monitoring protocol developed by the [Savory Institute](https://savory.global/) to measure whether land management practices are leading to genuine ecological improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Holistic Management** is the decision-making framework. EOV is how you measure whether those decisions are working.\n",
    "- **Land to Market** is the Savory Institute's verification program. Producers who demonstrate positive ecological trends through EOV monitoring can earn the Land to Market seal for their products.\n",
    "- **Ecological Health Index (EHI)** is the overall score calculated from 15 individual indicators measured at each monitoring site.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You establish fixed monitoring sites on your property\n",
    "2. At each site, you assess 15 ecological indicators (we will cover each one below)\n",
    "3. Each indicator gets a score from -2 (severely degraded) to +2 (thriving)\n",
    "4. Scores are summed into an overall EHI score ranging from -30 to +30\n",
    "5. You repeat assessments seasonally to track trends over time\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of EOV is in the **trend**. A single assessment tells you where you stand today. Repeated assessments over seasons and years show whether your land is on an upward or downward trajectory."

    "\n",
    "- **Baseline documentation**: Your initial EHI scores establish where you started\n",
    "- **Trend data**: Multi-season assessments show improvement trajectory\n",
    "- **Specific metrics**: Infiltration rates, plant diversity counts, and ground cover percentages give reviewers concrete numbers\n",

    "\n",
    "- The 15 ecological indicators cover soil, water, and plant health\n",
    "- Each indicator is scored from -2 to +2, with the sum giving your EHI score\n",
    "- Trends matter more than any single score\n",
    "- Photo points and infiltration tests add powerful supporting evidence\n",
    "- This data feeds directly into Land to Market enrollment and grant applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Walk your property and identify 2-3 representative monitoring sites\n",
    "- [ ] Establish photo points at each site with GPS coordinates and compass bearings\n",
    "- [ ] Conduct your first full 15-indicator assessment at each site\n",
    "- [ ] Run water infiltration tests at each site\n",
    "- [ ] Schedule seasonal reassessments on your calendar (same time each season)\n",
    "- [ ] Replace the sample data in this notebook with your own observations\n",
    "- [ ] Review the Savory Institute training materials for detailed scoring guidance\n",
    "- [ ] When you have 4 seasonal assessments, evaluate Land to Market enrollment readiness"
