    "   uv sync --extra data\n",
    "   uv run jupyter notebook\n",

    "## When and How to Collect Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Good data starts with good sampling. Follow this protocol to get consistent, reliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timing\n",
    "- **Best time:** Fall, after harvest or the end of the grazing season.\n",
    "- **Consistency matters:** Test at the same time each year so results are comparable.\n",
    "- **Avoid:** Right after applying fertilizer, lime, or manure (wait at least 6-8 weeks).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Depth\n",
    "- **Standard:** 0-6 inches for most routine tests (pH, nutrients, OM).\n",
    "- **Deep profile:** 6-12 inches if testing for compaction layers or deep nutrient placement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Pattern\n",
    "- Walk a **zigzag or W pattern** across the field.\n",
    "- Collect **15-20 cores per sample** and mix them together in a clean bucket.\n",
    "- Avoid unusual spots: fence lines, old manure piles, wet areas, and field borders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of Samples\n",
    "- One composite sample per **10-20 acres** of uniform soil.\n",
    "- If a field has obviously different zones (hilltop vs. bottom, sandy vs. clay), sample each zone separately."

    "\n",
    "- [ ] Identify the fields or pastures you want to test\n",
    "- [ ] Collect soil samples following the protocol in this notebook (15-20 cores per sample, 0-6 inch depth)\n",
    "- [ ] Send samples to a reputable lab (contact your local Extension office for recommendations)\n",
    "- [ ] Enter your results into this notebook to calculate amendment rates\n",
    "- [ ] If pH is below 6.0, get a lime recommendation and apply before the next growing season\n",
    "- [ ] Set up an annual testing schedule -- same fields, same time each year\n",
    "- [ ] Keep a simple spreadsheet or notebook tracking your results year over year\n",
    "- [ ] Use your soil data in grant applications (see the [Grant Writing for Farms](grant-writing-for-farms.ipynb) notebook)\n",
    "- [ ] Share your results with your NRCS conservationist or Extension agent for personalized advice"
