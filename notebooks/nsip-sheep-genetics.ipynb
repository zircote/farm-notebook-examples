    "# NSIP Sheep Genetics: Understanding and Using EBVs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook helps you understand and use Estimated Breeding Values (EBVs) to make smarter breeding decisions for your flock.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are EBVs?** They are numbers that estimate the genetic merit of an animal for specific traits. Think of them like a report card for genetics -- they tell you what an animal is likely to pass on to its offspring, not just how the animal itself performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "EBVs are more reliable than raw performance data because they account for environmental factors (feed, weather, management) and family history. A ram raised on excellent pasture might look great, but his EBVs tell you whether his lambs will also perform well regardless of conditions."

    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "1. Complete the `getting-started.ipynb` notebook first.\n",
    "2. Make sure the NSIP CLI is installed (`nsip --version` should work in your terminal).\n",
    "3. Run `uv sync --extra data` to install pandas and other dependencies.\n",

    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1. Start Jupyter with `uv run jupyter notebook` or `uv run jupyter lab`.\n",
    "2. Open this file (`nsip-sheep-genetics.ipynb`).\n",
    "3. Run each cell in order from top to bottom using **Shift + Enter**.\n",

    "\n",
    "| Trait | Abbreviation | What It Means | Goal |\n",
    "|-------|-------------|---------------|------|\n",
    "| Birth Weight | BWT | How heavy lambs are at birth | **Lower is better** -- reduces birthing difficulty |\n",
    "| Weaning Weight | WWT | How heavy lambs are at weaning (~60 days) | **Higher is better** -- faster growth |\n",
    "| Number of Lambs Born | NLB | How many lambs a ewe produces per lambing | **Higher is better** -- more lambs per ewe |\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you are buying a truck. The sticker says it can tow 10,000 lbs, but you know the dealer tested it going downhill with a tailwind. EBVs are like an independent, standardized towing test -- they strip away the lucky conditions and tell you what the truck (or in our case, the animal) can really do genetically.\n",
